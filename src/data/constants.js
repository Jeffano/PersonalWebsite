The project involved analyzing a comprehensive sales dataset and implementing advanced data preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for predictions. The model was built using Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other key libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. The model achieved a 5% margin of error in sales predictions, and the training process was optimized to reduce model training time by 20%. Various metrics, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R² score, were used to evaluate the model's performance.",
